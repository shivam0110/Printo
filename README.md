## Java maven project to convert windows application like word, text, images, etc. to pdf.

### I have used [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) to read data from various application and [ITEXT](https://itextpdf.com/en) to conver it to pdf. 
Currently its in CLI form where user have to provide source file path, destination file path and type of file.
